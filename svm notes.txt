Advantage of SVM

1. Effective in high dimensional space.
2. Effective in cases where number of 
   dimension is greater than number of samples.
3. Uses as a subset of training points in the decision function(called support vector).
   so it is memory efficient.
4. Versatile with different types of hyperplanes.


Disadvantage of SVM

1.If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples,
 there is a chance of overfitting .
2. SVM do not directly provide the probalility estimation.
